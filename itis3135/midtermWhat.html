                World of Warcraft Classic is a faithful recreation of the original MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online
                Role-Playing Game) experience from the early days of World of Warcraft.

                overcoming difficult quests, World of Warcraft Classic has garnered a dedicated and passionate player
