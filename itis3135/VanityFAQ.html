            <h2 class="bold">Q: Are refurbished computer parts reliable?<h2>
                    <span class="thin">A: Refurbished parts can offer good value and performance if purchased from
                        reputable sellers. Ensure they come with a warranty and have been thoroughly tested.</span>

        <div class="question">
            <h2 class="bold">Q: What is overclocking, and is it safe?<h2>
                    <span class="thin">
                        A: Overclocking involves increasing a component's clock rate to achieve higher performance.
                        While it can boost performance, it may void warranties and increase heat generation if not done
                        properly.</span>

        <div class="question">
            <h2 class="bold">Q: Is water cooling better than air cooling?<h2>
                    <span class="thin">A: Water cooling often provides superior thermal performance, especially for
                        high-performance systems or heavy overclocking. However, it's generally more complex, expensive,
                        and requires maintenance compared to air cooling.</span>

        <div class="question">
            <h2 class="bold">Q: What are the key components that significantly impact gaming performance?<h2>
                    <span class="thin">A: The primary components influencing gaming performance are the CPU, GPU
                        (graphics card), RAM, and storage (SSD/HDD). A powerful GPU is crucial for graphics-intensive
                        gaming, while a capable CPU handles processing tasks. Sufficient RAM and fast storage contribute
                        to smoother gameplay and faster loading times.</span>

        <div class="question">
            <h2 class="bold">Q: How important is cooling in a gaming PC, especially during extended gaming sessions?<h2>
                    <span class="thin">A: Cooling is crucial in gaming PCs to maintain optimal performance and prevent
                        overheating. Intensive gaming generates heat, and efficient cooling solutions (air or water)
                        help dissipate this heat, ensuring stable and consistent performance over extended
                        periods.</span>
