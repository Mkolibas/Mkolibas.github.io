            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple Inc.</a></h3>
            <p>The Apple Inc. website is a prime example of effective design principles.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The website utilizes a clean and minimalistic design with a predominantly
                    white background, providing excellent contrast for its content.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Apple maintains a consistent design language and layout throughout its
                    website, ensuring a cohesive and recognizable brand identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements on the Apple website are meticulously aligned, creating a
                    visually pleasing and organized layout.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Apple groups related content together logically, allowing users to
                    quickly access the information they need without unnecessary clutter or confusion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Apple website is an excellent example of a design that adheres to the CRAP principles, contributing
                to a user-friendly and visually appealing experience.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a></h3>
            <p>Craigslist is a classified advertisements website known for its outdated design and usability issues.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The website lacks contrast with a plain and outdated color scheme, making
                    it difficult to differentiate sections and text.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is minimal repetition of design elements, resulting in a lack of
                    consistency across various pages and listings.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements on Craigslist are often misaligned, with irregular spacing and
                    unpredictable layouts, creating a disorganized appearance.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Content is loosely organized, and it's often challenging to distinguish
                    between different sections or categories of listings, leading to confusion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Craigslist fails to follow the CRAP principles effectively, primarily due to its outdated design, lack of
                visual hierarchy, and poor usability, which results in a frustrating user experience.</p>
