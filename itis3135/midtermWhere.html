            <h3><strong>Realms and Zones:</strong></h3>
            <p>
                World of Warcraft Classic consists of different realms or servers where players interact. These realms
                offer distinct player experiences, including Player versus Environment (PvE) or Player versus Player
                (PvP)
                environments. Additionally, explore iconic zones like Elwynn Forest, Durotar, or Stranglethorn Vale,
                each
                with its own unique challenges and quests.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Resource Gathering:</strong></h3>
            <p>
                In various zones, players can gather resources vital for crafting or other purposes. For instance,
                Elwynn Forest provides abundant herbs like Peacebloom and Silverleaf, while mining enthusiasts might
                find copper nodes scattered across Dun Morogh.
