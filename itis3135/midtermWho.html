                World of Warcraft is a massively popular MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) that
                creates an immersive world where players interact within a vast digital landscape. At any given moment,
                numerous players inhabit this virtual universe, allowing for diverse social interactions, cooperative
                play, and competitive challenges. MMORPGs like WoW Classic offer various servers catering to different
                playstyles, from PvP (Player versus Player) engagements to group-based Raids or leisurely exploration.
